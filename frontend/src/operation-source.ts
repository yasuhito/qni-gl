 * - Generating new operations when existing ones are dragged out
 * - Managing the initial setup of operations
 * - Handling events related to operation creation, grabbing, and discarding
 * - Maintaining a visual representation of the operation within the palette
 *
 * It extends the PIXI.js Container class to integrate with the rendering system and
